[Lasca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasca "Lasca game article") is a checkers (or draughts) variants invented by the World Chess Champion [Emanuel Lasker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Lasker "The Master") in 1911. Lasca is played in a 7x7 chess-like board using only the dark squares, like checkers, but the major difference between them and other draughts variants is that instead of pieces being removed from the board when captured, they are placed under the piece that jumped them, forming a column that allows them to be later released. This boils down to a more exciting experience, in which epic comebacks come true.
