playLasca.org is an open source web application done to play [lasca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasca "Lasca game article") anywhere/anytime against anyone you want in a fancy user-friendly interface.

[Lasca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasca "Lasca game article") is a checkers (or draughts) variant invented by the World Chess Champion [Emanuel Lasker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Lasker "The Master") in 1911. It is played in a 7x7 chess-like board using only the dark squares, like checkers, but the major difference between them is that instead of pieces being removed from the board when captured, they are placed under the piece that jumped them, forming a column that permits them to be later released. This boils down to a more exciting experience, in which epic comebacks become possible.
